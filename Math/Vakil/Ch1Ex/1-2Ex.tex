\begin{exercise}
    A category in which each morphism is an isomorphism is called a groupoid. 
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item A perverse definition of a group is: is a groupoid with one object. Make sense of this. 
        \item Describe a groupoid that is not a group. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    If $A$ is an object in the category $\cC$, show that the invertible elements of $\Mor(A, A)$ from a group. What are the automorphism groups of a set $X$ and a vector space $V$. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Let $(\cdot)^{\vee \vee}: f.d.Vec_k \to f.d.Vec_k$ be the double dual functor from the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over $k$ to itself. Show that $(\cdot)^{\vee \vee}$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on $f.d.Vec_k$. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Let $\cV$ be the category whose objects are the $k$-vector spaces $k^n$ for $n \ge 0$ and whose morphisms are linear transformations. Show that $\cV \to f.d.Vec_k$ gives an equivalence of categories by describing an ``inverse'' functor.
