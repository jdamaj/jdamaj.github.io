\begin{exercise}
    Let $\cO_p$ be the ring of germs at some point $p$. Show that $m_p$, the ideal of germs vanishing at $p$, is the only maximal ideal of $\cO_p$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Note that this ideal is maximal since $\cO_p/m_p \cong \bR$. To show that it is the only maximal ideal it is enough to show that every element of $\cO_p \setminus m_p$ is invertible. Let $(f, U)$ be a germ not vanishing at $p$, we can find some open set $p \in V \subset U$ such that $f$ does not vanish on $V$. We will have $(f,U) = (f, V)$ as germs. Now, the function $1/f$ will be continuous on $V$ and so the germ $(1/f, V)$ is a germ and satisfies $(1/f, V) \cdot (f, V) = (1,V)$ and so $(f, U)$ is invertible, as desired.  
\end{proof}
